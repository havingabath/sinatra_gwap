To run the app first you must run the bundler to ensure you have all necessary gems
on your machine, from within the folder run:

bundle install

then to run the app, from within the folder again run

ruby -rubygems babel.rb

The app should then be available locally in your browser at:

localhost:4567

*NB - this app has been developed with ruby 1.8.7, (the stable version found pre installed on 
all current macs!)

1. fully commented Application files are all in the root folder, babel.rb being the first to look at. Also in the root are the Gemfile, config and development.db files.

2. public folder contains the following
	CSS style sheets, one borrowed (reset.css) and one I wrote myself (style.css)
	Javascript - custom.js contains the script for the timer, I borrowed it but
				it had to be adjusted to suit my needs, closure was required at the end
				to make it recursive as I wanted to pass the startime with each call.

3. views - contains my embedded ruby files (.erb) - all of which I wrote myself except for the	
			intial layout which i templated from someone else and adjusted to my needs.

4. spec - This contains two test files containing one test each, I started this project
			with the best of agile intentions to use TDD and BDD, I wrote one test and decided 
			I just wasn't in the mood to learn a whole new testing framework. So I hacked
			my way through it, shame on me (I probably should have removed the folder to
			hide this fact)!
			
FINALLY - YOU CAN SEE THE APP LIVE AT babel.heroku.com
providing their site isn't down, their service to non paying clients can be iffy!
